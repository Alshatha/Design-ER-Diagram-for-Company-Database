The ER diagram models a company with four main entities: Employee, Department, Project, and Dependent. Key relationships include:

Employees work on multiple Projects, with WorkingHours recorded.

Each Employee belongs to one Department and may supervise others (recursive).

Each Department is managed by one Employee (with HireDate) and may have multiple projects and employees.

Each Project belongs to one Department.

Dependents are linked to their parent Employee and are removed if the employee leaves.

Locations is a multivalued attribute for Departments.

The diagram ensures proper cardinality, constraints, and relationship attributes per business rules.
